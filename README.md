# Portfolio Project

Welcome to my portfolio project! This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. Below, you'll find an overview of the directory structure.

## Directory Structure

### CSS Files

1. **general.css**: Contains general class styles used throughout the portfolio. (Alphabetically ordered)

2. **component.css**: Contains styles for specific components used in the portfolio. (Alphabetically ordered)

3. **style.css**: Defines media query rules for responsive design across all pages. (Alphabetically ordered)

4. **designsystem.txt**: Guidelines and conventions followed for the development of the CSS.

### Script Files

1. **header.js**: Handles the functionality for making the header sticky only when scrolling up, after scrolling strictly greater than one viewport height. It also implements a sliding-in effect for the mobile hamburger menu button.

2. **home.js**: Manages smooth scrolling for bookmarks and facilitates sending emails via formspree.io.

3. **pagination.js**: Provides functionality for smooth animations in the pagination of the blog page. While pagination doesn't change the content of the page, it enhances user experience with a cool animation.

### Image Directories

1. **backgrounds/**: Contains images used as backgrounds for various sections of the portfolio.

2. **projects/**: Holds images and videos related to the projects showcased in the portfolio.

3. **blogs/**: Includes images and videos related to blog content, if applicable.

4. **logos/**: Stores logos used within the portfolio.
