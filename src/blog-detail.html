          What is Competitive Programming ?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet
          or a local network, involving participants trying to program according
          to provided specifications. Contestants are referred to as sport
          programmers. Competitive programming is recognized and supported by
          several multinational software and Internet companies, which often use
          it as a form of recruiting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Actually many programmers at the beginning of their career start with
          competitive programming, and then they move to the industry. So, it is
          a good way to start your career as a programmer too. Even the Big Tech
          Giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. use competitive
          programming as a way to recruit new employees. Usually they have a
          coding round in which they ask you to solve some problems. So, if you
          are good at competitive programming, you have a good chance to get a
          job in these companies.
        </p>

        <h2 id="why-competitive-programming-">Why Competitive Programming ?</h2>
        <p>
          As i tried to explain above, competitive programming is a good way to
          start your career as a programmer. But there are many other reasons to
          start competitive programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a programmer you not just coding to make something work, you need
          to be able to solve a real world problems. You need to write an
          efficient code. You need to be able to think in a different way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Competitive programming is a good way to improve your problem solving
          skills. You will learn how to think in a different way. You donâ€™t want
          to write a code that works, you want to write a code that works fast.
          You will learn how to write efficient code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now a days even milliseconds matter. If you are working on a project
          and you need to make it faster, you will need to write efficient code.
          If you are a developer in your company and you are assigned to a
          project that will need to calculate Shortest distance of two object
          from multiples paths, what would you do ? Will you think efficient
          algorithm to solve this problem like Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm or will you
          just write a code that works ?
        </p>
        <p>
          What if the data is millions of ordered data, and you are working on a
          feature that will find the data by id? will you go through all the
          data to find the data or will you use a data structure that will help
          you to find the data in O(log n) time?
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are still reading i think we are on the same page why we need
          to start competitive programming.
        </p>
        <p>To summarize why we need to start competitive programming:</p>
        <pre><code>- To improve our problem solving skills.
            - To learn how to think in a different way.
            - (emphasis on this)To join the Big Tech Giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.
            - To learn how to write efficient code.
            - To learn how to write a code that works fast.
            - (ðŸ˜œ) To impress your friends.

          How to start Competitive Programming ?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Now we know why we need to start competitive programming, letâ€™s talk
          about how to start competitive programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before starting competitive programming journey, we need to know
          programming language first. There are multiple programming languages,
          but the most popular programming languages are C++, Java, Python, etc.
          I recommend you to start with C++ or Python. If you are a beginner, i
          recommend you to start with Python. If you are a little bit familiar
          with programming, i recommend you to start with C++. Or you can go
          with Java or any of your favorite programming language choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          After you choose your programming language, we need to start learning
          from different source. Personally i would recommend you to start with
          learning
        </p>
        <pre><code>- Basics programming language of your choice.
            - Data Structures
            - Algorithms
      </code></pre>
        <p>
          You can learn these topics from different sources like books, YouTube
          channels, etc. I will list some of the resources at the end of this
          blog post.
        </p>
        <p>
          After learning those thing(it doesnâ€™t mean you must master them) or be
          comfortable with them, you can start practicing competitive
          programming. I will list some of the resources at the end of this blog
          post.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Important Points</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>You must not compare yourself with others.</strong></li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >You must not expect yourself to be a master in a few month or
              weeks</strong
            >
          </li>
          <li><strong>You must not give up.</strong></li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 id="how-to-keep-going-">How to keep going ?</h2>
        <p>
          You know sometimes doing competitive programming might feel like you
          are doing nothing except you solve problems and submit them to the
          contest or the site. Or sometimes it really gets frustrating when you
          are not able to solve a problem. But you must not give up. You must
          keep going. You must keep practicing. You must keep learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if you feel those things, remember these skill you are developing
          now will be the shield and sword for you in the future. You will be
          able to solve real world problems. While others are struggling to
          solve a problem. You will find yourself on the top of your team or
          your area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think big, you might not always develop some kind of CRUD application
          or some kind of web application. You might develop a system that will
          help millions of people. You might get involved in a project that will
          require a true problem solver programmer like you. You might get
          involved in a project that will require a programmer that can write
          efficient code. You might get involved in a project that will require
          a programmer that can write a code that works fast. May be the project
          is brand new database system, or a very low level system that requires
          a mind of problem solver programmer like you.
        </p>
        <p>
          So keep going, keep practicing, keep learning. You will be able to do
          it.
        </p>

        <h2 id="where-to-practice-">Where to Practice ?</h2>
        <p>
          Currentley there are many sites that you can practice competitive
          programming. I will list some of them below. All of them has a lot of
          problems and contests
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <a href="https://codeforces.com/" target="_blank">Codeforces</a>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This one might be the most popular site to practice competitive
          programming. Honestly speaking it is also the most challenging site to
          practice competitive programming.
        </p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank">Hackerrank</a>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Hackerrank might be my recommendation for you if you are a beginner.
          It also has a lot of tutorials and articles that you can read to learn
          more about competitive programming. It also has some kind of job board
          where you can apply for jobs.
        </p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li><a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank">Leetcode</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Leetcode is the most popular site for recruiters to recruit new
          employees. If you know someone who is preparing for interviews in big
          tech companies, they will probably use Leetcode to practice. It is
          beginner friendly too, at the same time they have a lot of hard
          problems too.
        </p>
        <ol start="4">

        </ol>
        <p>
          Personal favorite of mine. It is beginner friendly too. It is a very
          simple UI. It has also ranking based on User, Country and University.
          It is also beginner friendly.

          Topcoder might be a little bit different from other sites and
          unfriendly for beginners. But it is a good site to practice
          competitive programming. They have really good hard problems and the
          solution is also available. You can learn a lot from their problems.

          YouTube Channels to Learn Competitive Programming
        </h2>
        <p>
          So before i mentioned the good youtube channel here. There might be
          other youtube channels that you can learn competitive programming that
          i donâ€™t know. So if you know any other youtube channel that you can
          learn competitive programming, please let me know in the comment
          section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, you gotta see winner of big competition like Google Code
          Jam, Facebook Hacker Cup, ICPCT, etc. They usually have youtube
          channel where they share their experience and tips to solve problems.
          You can learn a lot from them. For example Legendary programmers like
          Tourist, Errichto, Petr, Mostafa Saad, William lin, SecondThread, etc.
          They have youtube channel where they share their experience and tips
          to solve problems. You can learn a lot from them.

          So today i hope you can take away something from this post. I hope you
          can learn competitive programming and become a better programmer.
          Being a programmer is not just about writing code. It is also about
          problem solving. So keep practicing, keep learning, keep improving.
          You will be able to do it.
