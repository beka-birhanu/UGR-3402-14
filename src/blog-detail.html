            What is Competitive Programming ?
          </h2>
          <p class="p-2">
            Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the
            Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to
            program according to provided specifications. Contestants are
            referred to as sport programmers. Competitive programming is
            recognized and supported by several multinational software and
            Internet companies, which often use it as a form of recruiting.
          </p>
          <p class="p-2">
            Actually many programmers at the beginning of their career start
            with competitive programming, and then they move to the industry.
            So, it is a good way to start your career as a programmer too. Even
            the Big Tech Giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.
            use competitive programming as a way to recruit new employees.
            Usually they have a coding round in which they ask you to solve some
            problems. So, if you are good at competitive programming, you have a
            good chance to get a job in these companies.

            Why Competitive Programming ?
          </h2>
          <p class="p-2">
            As i tried to explain above, competitive programming is a good way
            to start your career as a programmer. But there are many other
            reasons to start competitive programming.
          </p>
          <p class="p-2">
            As a programmer you not just coding to make something work, you need
            to be able to solve a real world problems. You need to write an
            efficient code. You need to be able to think in a different way.
          </p>
          <p class="p-2">
            Competitive programming is a good way to improve your problem
            solving skills. You will learn how to think in a different way. You
            don’t want to write a code that works, you want to write a code that
            works fast. You will learn how to write efficient code.
          </p>
          <p class="p-2">
            Now a days even milliseconds matter. If you are working on a project
            and you need to make it faster, you will need to write efficient
            code. If you are a developer in your company and you are assigned to
            a project that will need to calculate Shortest distance of two
            object from multiples paths, what would you do ? Will you think
            efficient algorithm to solve this problem like Dijkstra’s algorithm
            or will you just write a code that works ?
          </p>
          <p class="p-2">
            What if the data is millions of ordered data, and you are working on
            a feature that will find the data by id? will you go through all the
            data to find the data or will you use a data structure that will
            help you to find the data in O(log n) time?
          </p>
          <p class="p-2">
            If you are still reading i think we are on the same page why we need
            to start competitive programming.
          </p>
          <p class="p-2">
            To summarize why we need to start competitive programming:
          </p>
          <ul class="p-3">
            - To improve our problem solving skills.

            <li>- To learn how to think in a different way.</li>
            <li>
              - (emphasis on this)To join the Big Tech Giants like Google,
              Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.
            </li>
            <li>- To learn how to write efficient code.</li>
            <li>- To learn how to write a code that works fast.</li>

            How to start Competitive Programming ?
          </h2>
          <p class="p-2">
            Now we know why we need to start competitive programming, let’s talk
            about how to start competitive programming.
          </p>
          <p class="p-2">
            Before starting competitive programming journey, we need to know
            programming language first. There are multiple programming
            languages, but the most popular programming languages are C++, Java,
            Python, etc. I recommend you to start with C++ or Python. If you are
            a beginner, i recommend you to start with Python. If you are a
            little bit familiar with programming, i recommend you to start with
            C++. Or you can go with Java or any of your favorite programming
            language choice.
          </p>
          <p class="p-2">
            After you choose your programming language, we need to start
            learning from different source. Personally i would recommend you to
            start with learning
          </p>
          <ul>
            Basics programming language of your choice.
            <li>- Data Structures</li>
            <li>- Algorithms</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="p-2">
            You can learn these topics from different sources like books,
            YouTube channels, etc. I will list some of the resources at the end
            of this blog post.
          </p>
          <p class="p-2">
            After learning those thing(it doesn’t mean you must master them) or
            be comfortable with them, you can start practicing competitive
            programming. I will list some of the resources at the end of this
            blog post.
          </p>
          <p class="p-2"><strong>Important Points</strong></p>
          <ol class="p-3">
            <li class="p-3">
              <strong>You must not compare yourself with others.</strong>

            </li>
            <li class="p-3"><strong>You must not give up.</strong></li>

        <section>
          <h2 id="how-to-keep-going-" class="h-3">How to keep going ?</h2>
          <p class="p-2">
            You know sometimes doing competitive programming might feel like you
            are doing nothing except you solve problems and submit them to the
            contest or the site. Or sometimes it really gets frustrating when
            you are not able to solve a problem. But you must not give up. You
            must keep going. You must keep practicing. You must keep learning.
          </p>
          <p class="p-2">
            Even if you feel those things, remember these skill you are
            developing now will be the shield and sword for you in the future.
            You will be able to solve real world problems. While others are
            struggling to solve a problem. You will find yourself on the top of
            your team or your area.
          </p>
          <p class="p-2">
            Think big, you might not always develop some kind of CRUD
            application or some kind of web application. You might develop a
            system that will help millions of people. You might get involved in
            a project that will require a true problem solver programmer like
            you. You might get involved in a project that will require a
            programmer that can write efficient code. You might get involved in
            a project that will require a programmer that can write a code that
            works fast. May be the project is brand new database system, or a
            very low level system that requires a mind of problem solver
            programmer like you.
          </p>
          <p class="p-2">
            So keep going, keep practicing, keep learning. You will be able to
            do it.

              Currentley there are many sites that you can practice competitive
              programming. I will list some of them below. All of them has a lot
              of problems and contests
            </p>

            </ol>
            <p class="p-3">
              This one might be the most popular site to practice competitive
              programming. Honestly speaking it is also the most challenging
              site to practice competitive programming.

            <p class="p-3">
              Hackerrank might be my recommendation for you if you are a
              beginner. It also has a lot of tutorials and articles that you can
              read to learn more about competitive programming. It also has some
              kind of job board where you can apply for jobs.

            <p class="p-3">
              Leetcode is the most popular site for recruiters to recruit new
              employees. If you know someone who is preparing for interviews in
              big tech companies, they will probably use Leetcode to practice.
              It is beginner friendly too, at the same time they have a lot of
              hard problems too.

              Personal favorite of mine. It is beginner friendly too. It is a
              very simple UI. It has also ranking based on User, Country and
              University. It is also beginner friendly.

            YouTube Channels to Learn Competitive Programming
          </h2>
          <p class="p-2">
            So before i mentioned the good youtube channel here. There might be
            other youtube channels that you can learn competitive programming
            that i don’t know. So if you know any other youtube channel that you
            can learn competitive programming, please let me know in the comment
            section.
          </p>
          <p class="p-2">
            Secondly, you gotta see winner of big competition like Google Code
            Jam, Facebook Hacker Cup, ICPCT, etc. They usually have youtube
            channel where they share their experience and tips to solve
            problems. You can learn a lot from them. For example Legendary
            programmers like Tourist, Errichto, Petr, Mostafa Saad, William lin,
            SecondThread, etc. They have youtube channel where they share their
            experience and tips to solve problems. You can learn a lot from
            them.

              So today i hope you can take away something from this post. I hope
